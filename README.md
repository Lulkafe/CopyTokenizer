# CopyTokenizer
A simple web app that makes copying many words/lines easier. \
The app acceps user text as input and generates clickable tokens.
When the token is clicked/tapped, the text of the token is copied to clipboard.

A demo is available [here](https://lulkafe.github.io/CopyTokenizer/).

## Motivation behind project
I sometimes needed to copy a list of items. \
It was acceptable to do a few items, but as the number increased, \
it became a pain for me to select a word and press Ctrl+C every time. \
Therefore I wanted something to reduce the burden. 

## Data Privacy
The input is processed at the client side. It is never sent to anywhere.
