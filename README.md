# CopyableTokenizer
This is a very simple app.
Its purpose is to generate tokens from user text. \
When a token is clicked/tapped, the text of the token is copied to clipboard.

## Motivation behind project
I sometimes needed to copy a list of items. \
It was OK to do a few items, but as the number increases, \
it became a pain for me to select a word and press Ctrl+C every time. \
Therefore I wanted something to reduce the burden. 

## How to use
Paste/input your text in the input field, \
so corresponding tokens are generated in the output field. 

You can click or tap it, and the text is copied to your clipboard. \
You can paste it whenever place you like. 

By default, if you click tokens, these are grayed-out. \
This is to prevent to forget which token you already clicked/tapped. 

If you want to exclude some characters (e.g. commas), \
you can do by the settings window.

## Data Privacy
The input is totally processed at the client side, and is never sent to any servers.
