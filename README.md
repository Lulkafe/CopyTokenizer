# CopyableTokenizer
This is a web app to generate copyable tokens from user input. \
When a token is clicked/tapped, the text inside it is copied to clipboard.

## How to use
Paste/input your text in the input field, \
so corresponding tokens are generated in the output. 

If you want to exclude some characters (e.g. commas), \
you can do by the settings window.

## Motivation behind project
I sometimes needed to copy a list of items. \
It was a pain for me to select a word and press Ctrl+C every time, \
so I wanted something to reduce the burden. 

## Data Privacy
The input is processed at the client side, and is never sent to any servers. \
You don't have to concern about if your data is used. \
