# CopyTokenizer
This app generates word/line tokens from user text. \
When the token is clicked/tapped, the text of the token is copied to clipboard.

## Motivation behind project
I sometimes needed to copy a list of items. \
It was acceptable to do manually a few items, but as the number increases, \
it became a pain for me to select a word and press Ctrl+C every time. \
Therefore I wanted something to reduce the burden. 

## Data Privacy
The input is processed at the client side, and is never sent to any servers.
